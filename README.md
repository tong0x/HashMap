# HashMap
Basic implementation of HashMap using separate chaining in Python.

Steps: 
1. Make sure HashMap.py is in the same folder as the program you plan on using it with.
2. Import HashMap.py using `from HashMap import HashMap`
3. Initialize new instance of HashMap. For example, `my_map = HashMap()`. Now you can use HashMap's method's by calling `my_map.function()`.
4. To access unit test cases, open HashMapTest.py and run it in terminal.
